# LFCS
         # This is the l-Length Contiguous Frequent Subsequence (i.e., LCFS) Explorer.          
         ## It mines and output a user-defined length of contiguous patterns with a SINGLE pass of the database.          
         ### This data mining explorer  avails:          
         1. Provision of unique patterns repetitive frequencies.          
         2. Provision of unique patterns relative and absolute support.          
         3. Provision of unique patterns Super-sequence indexes.          
         4. Exploration and sorting of identified patterns
         
         This LFCS framework is implemented as an app for Streamlit.io
         
         [Click here to launch the app](https://share.streamlit.io/arhvel/lfcs/main/LFCSstreamlit.py)
         
         ### It requires your two column data (i.e. Index and Sequence columns only).
         
         Thank you.
