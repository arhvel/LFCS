         ## It mines and output a user-defined length of contiguous patterns with a SINGLE pass of the database.          
         ### This data mining explorer  avails:          
         1. Provision of unique patterns repetitive frequencies.          
         2. Provision of unique patterns relative and absolute support.          
         3. Provision of unique patterns Super-sequence indexes.          
         4. Exploration and sorting of identified patterns
