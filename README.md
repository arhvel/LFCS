# LFCS
         This is the l-Length Contiguous Frequent Subsequence (i.e., LCFS) Explorer.          
         It mines and output a user-defined length of contiguous patterns from a sequential database.          
         It is a vertical pattern mining algorithm (i.e. one single pass of the database).
         This data mining explorer  avails:          
         1. Provision of unique patterns repetitive frequencies.          
         2. Provision of unique patterns relative and absolute support.          
         3. Provision of unique patterns Super-sequence indexes.          
         4. Exploration and sorting of identified patterns
         
         This LFCS framework is implemented as an app for Streamlit.io
         
         Launch and use the app via https://share.streamlit.io/arhvel/lfcs/main/LFCSstreamlit.py
         
         It takes two columns data (i.e. Index and Sequence columns only) as input. See the sampleData.csv example.
         
         Thank you.
